# Dashboard Widgets

This project contains a collection of interactive widgets designed for a dynamic dashboard, including real-time sports scores, weather updates, and financial market summaries.

## Project Structure

The widgets are organized into a modular structure within the `widgets` folder, allowing for easy expansion and maintenance.

/src

NFLScoresContent.js
NFLScoresContent.css
/NHLScores
NHLScoresContent.js

Each widget folder contains all the necessary files for that widget to function independently.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions to expand the dashboard with new widgets. If you have an idea for a widget or have created one that you'd like to share, please follow these steps:

1. **Fork the Repository**
   - Begin by forking the repository to your own GitHub account.

2. **Create a Feature Branch**
   - Create a branch in your forked repository for your widget. It's best to name the branch something that reflects the widget you're adding, for example: `feature/weather-widget`.

3. **Develop Your Widget**
   - Develop your widget within a new folder under the `/src/widgets` directory.
   - Ensure your widget follows the existing coding standards and structure.
   - Include a separate CSS file for styling if needed.
   - Make sure to test your widget thoroughly.

4. **Documentation**
   - Update the `README.md` with information about your widget. Include any setup instructions and dependencies.
   - Add comments in your code where necessary to explain complex logic.

5. **Submit a Pull Request**
   - Commit your changes and push your branch to your forked repository.
   - Submit a pull request to the main repository with a clear list of what you've done.
   - Include screenshots and a detailed description in your pull request.

6. **Review Process**
   - Wait for the maintainers to review your pull request. Be open to feedback and make changes if requested.
   - Once approved, the maintainers will merge your pull request.

### Widget Guidelines

When creating a new widget, please consider the following guidelines to maintain a consistent user experience:

- **Modularity**: Your widget should be self-contained and modular.
- **Responsiveness**: Design your widget to be responsive and mobile-friendly.
- **Accessibility**: Ensure your widget is accessible according to WCAG standards.
